for FE groups identification test

cs1.mat - The damped modes after -5 are not well defined. For example, -5.4319 does not have a well defined straight line near the real axis
cs2.mat - All modes except the most damped one are estimated, the most damped mode does not have a vertical line.
cs3.mat - All modes estimated
cs4.mat - Incorrect number of points estimated for a line, which is not well defined near the real axis (fig saved)
cs5.mat - all modes estimated
cs6.mat - unable to estimate modes
cs7.mat - fails to estimate modes due to ill conditioning of lines
cs8.mat - fails to estimate modes due to ill conditioning of lines
cs9.mat - all modes estimated
